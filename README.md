This code defines and provisions an AWS infrastructure that includes 
a VPC, an internet gateway, two subnets, a route table, a security group, an EC2 instance, an Elastic IP address, and an elastic load balancer.
It sets up a basic Apache web server on the EC2 instance and allows inbound HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH traffic through a security group.
